In the meantime, please take a moment to respond to this email and answer the following questions:\n\n1. What do you currently use for your personal banking (traditional bank, credit union, neobank, etc.)?\n2. How do you currently manage your personal finances (budgeting app, spreadsheet, etc.)?\n3. Which of Sediment's features are you most interested in? (checking account bugets, bill pay, transaction round-ups, etc.)\n\nThanks again for being part of this early stage.\n\nSincerely,\nKyle Rummens\nFounder, Sediment",
