You're officially on the waitlist for the bank account that enforces your budget, prioritizes your bills, and makes saving automatic — by default, not afterthought.\n\nHere's why this waitlist matters: the banking industry is highly regulated — as it should be.To launch, we need funding to handle the legal, compliance, and operational costs that come with building a banking product.The waitlist helps prove to investors that there's real demand for a better kind of banking.\n\nJust like layers of sediment slowly form stone, the goal of this app is to provide built-in banking tools that help people strengthen their financial foundation.\n\nThanks again for being part of this early stage.\n\nSincerely,\nKyle Rummens\nFounder, Sediment",
